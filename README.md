# multiple-pastebins README

This extension lets you manage multiple pastebins inside vscode.
It creates 10 "pastebins" saved in a json file in the extension's global vscode configuration.

It adds the following commands and default keybinds:

* `multiple-pastebins.copy_0`: Copies to pastebin 0
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_1`: Copies to pastebin 1
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_2`: Copies to pastebin 2
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_3`: Copies to pastebin 3
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_4`: Copies to pastebin 4
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_5`: Copies to pastebin 5
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_6`: Copies to pastebin 6
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_7`: Copies to pastebin 7
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_8`: Copies to pastebin 8
* `multiple-pastebins.copy_9`: Copies to pastebin 9
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_0`: Pastes from pastebin 0
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_1`: Pastes from pastebin 1
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_2`: Pastes from pastebin 2
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_3`: Pastes from pastebin 3
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_4`: Pastes from pastebin 4
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_5`: Pastes from pastebin 5
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_6`: Pastes from pastebin 6
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_7`: Pastes from pastebin 7
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_8`: Pastes from pastebin 8
* `multiple-pastebins.paste_9`: Pastes from pastebin 9

It also adds a small tree view in the explorer Container, which contains a preview of all your pastebins.
It tells you if a pastebin is empty and appends a `$` sign to pastebins with content for whitespace visibility.
